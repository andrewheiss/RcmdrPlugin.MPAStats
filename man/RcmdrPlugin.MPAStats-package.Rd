\description{
This package provides an R Commander plugin that offers a 
unified menu of new and pre-existing statistical functions 
related to public management and policy analysis statistics.

The plug-in adds an additional top-level menu named \strong{MPA Statistics} to 
the \emph{R Commander} interface, with the following submenus: 
\strong{Descriptive statistics"}, \strong{Single-sample statistics}, 
\strong{Paired value testing}, \strong{Bivariate analysis} (with additional submenus 
that divide statistical tests by the level of measurement of the dependent and 
independent variables), and \strong{Multivariate analysis}. Additionally, there is 
a function to calculate logistic regression factor change coefficients (e^b) at 
\strong{Models -> Factor change coefficients}.
